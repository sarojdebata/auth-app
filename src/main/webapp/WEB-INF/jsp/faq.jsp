A list of initial filing period dates for submitting your application to the CSU can be found here.
After the initial application period, some campuses may continue to accept applications on a space-available basis. For high-demand (impacted) majors, you must file during the initial filing period. Filing your application during the initial filing period is strongly encouraged for all applicants to facilitate your attending your campus of choice.<br/><br/>
What if I miss the initial filing period?<br/><br/> 
Some campuses will continue to accept applications after the initial filing period, though many will not. In addition, if you are applying to a high-demand (impacted) major at any CSU campus, then you must file during the initial filing period. Be sure to check the application status page for the campus(es) in which you are interested to learn more about application filing periods, closed majors and impacted programs.</p>
